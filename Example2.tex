\begin{itemize}
\item Contact: e-mail and class forum on classes*V2.
\item \href{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8gos1knztfhdgty/IzxBeqKvUW}{Dropbox folder} with materials (lecture and section slides, homework, solutions, readings, and R and \LaTeX{} materials).
\item classesV2 for grades and uploading assignments.
\end{itemize}
\pause \item Office hours. M: 4:00-5:00 and T: 3:00-4:00, place RZK 220.   
\end{itemize}
}

  \pause \item Get data and replication files quickly.
\begin{itemize} 
\item 18 of 120 political science journals have replication policies
\item Only 16\% of surveyed individuals (students + PolMeth) were able to get complete dataset and replication files. 21\% got a limited dataset and a complete code. The plurarity (24\%) got a limited dataset but no code.
\item Replication tips: \href{http://politicalsciencereplication.wordpress.com/}{Replication blog}
\end{itemize}
  \pause \item Deadlines to keep you on track.
  \pause \item Work in small groups (2-3 people): again, let me know if you have trouble finding partners.
